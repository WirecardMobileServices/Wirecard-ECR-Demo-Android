# Wirecard-ECR-Demo-Android

Electronic Cash Register (ECR) Integration is to allow front-line users such as cashiers to input/trigger supported transactions at single point, and at the same time, relevant information needs to be passed to a Payment Device which sends the information securely to a payment host for authentication and approval. As such, there is a need for an interface to send data between ECR and Payment Device.

## Installation

Set up with Gradle. See [Developer Portal](https://wirecardmobileservices.github.io/Wirecard-ECR-Developer/int-setup-android-gradle/)

## Demo application
